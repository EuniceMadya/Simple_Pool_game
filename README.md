# Simple_Pool_game
This is a simple pool game which only implements the function for hitting balls with a cue. The implementation used 3 design patterns: Factory method, Builder and Singleton.

This can be regarded as a simple example for applying 3 design patterns.

This will be updated shortly, with more functionalities to become a more complete pool game.
